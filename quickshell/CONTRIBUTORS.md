## License Change Process

To relicense this project from GPL-3.0 to MIT, explicit consent is required from all contributors listed above (excluding automated bots and trivial contributions).

### Contact Template

```
Subject: Permission to relicense DankMaterialShell from GPL-3.0 to MIT

Hi [Name],

I'm the maintainer of DankMaterialShell. You contributed to this project with the following:

- [Describe their specific contributions]
- Commits: [Number of commits]

I'm planning to change the license from GPL-3.0 to MIT to make it easier for others to use and integrate this project into their work, including commercial and proprietary software.

Could you please reply confirming you agree to relicense your contributions under MIT? A simple "I agree" or "I consent to relicensing under MIT" is sufficient.

If you have any concerns or questions, I'm happy to discuss them.

Thank you,
[Your name]
```

## Notes

- **github-actions[bot]** and **copilot-swe-agent[bot]** are automated processes and do not hold copyright
- Contributors with <50 lines of meaningful code changes are not listed as their contributions are likely below the threshold of originality
- Some contributors appear with multiple email addresses - these have been consolidated
- Configuration file contributions (Nix, TOML, CSS themes) are included as they involve creative decisions

## Total Contributors Requiring Consent

**21 contributors** (including the primary author)

## Alternative: Rewrite Instead of Relicense

If any contributor cannot be reached or does not consent, their specific contributions can be identified and rewritten to enable relicensing. The primary codebase (>90%) is controlled by the two primary authors (bbedward and purian23).
